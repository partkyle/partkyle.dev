This was a 48 hour gamejam, so it was limited in scope intentionally. It has not been modified since. I do have some notes on ways I would improve this if I was going to continue this idea moving forward.

Ludum Dare was a great experience and it left me with a bunch of feedback from users that played my game. I think it improved my skills considerably, as this was my first real attempt doing my own 3D modeling.

## Demo

{{< youtube yhj2D5uuFYE >}}

## Source Code

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/partkyle/bellhivers).

## Playable Demo

It's playable on [itch.io](https://partkyle.itch.io/bellhivers) or as a downloadable executable on that page.

## Tools

- godot as the game engine, using gdscript
- blockbench for 3d models
- bfxr for sound effects

## Afterthoughts

There are some performance issues while playing on a browser that aren't easily noticed when playing on a high powered gaming PC. In future gamejams I plan on focusing more on this, becuase I think more users will be willing to play a game if it runs in a browser.

This uses shaders and particle effects for some really simple visuals (i.e. the beams and the firing). I think those are pretty heavy handed for the visuals they are giving, and having the ability to disable those would go a long way to making it playable.
