This is my home page to my website.

I will be placing articles in here using Hugo to document some of the things I have worked on in the past, as well as current projects I have going forward.

I doubt this will be the final version of this website. It's also going to be a little messy while I iterate on this to make it what I want it to be.

Content first, then refactor later. Who knows. I may just delete this entire thing anyway.
